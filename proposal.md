# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Breakout 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

Essentially I'm going to code my own version of the atari game breakout.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
The software should be able to functionally produce images of many "bricks", a paddle, and a ball. From there you should be able to play the game in which the ball bounces of the paddle and breaks bricks, eventually until none remain or you lose. I'm going to be working in LUA so I will re-use the class feature from the PONG assignment, as well as use plenty of game states. The goal is for when game state is in play the ball can collide with the bricks, and erase them. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A simple game of breakout, where there are paddles and bricks that break once they are hit.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
I would like to allow the bricks to be able to have different forms, for example a green one may take mul;tiple hits to break, where a blue one breaks after one hit. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Best case scenario I would like to have the ability for the bricks to be randomly generated (in terms of what level they are), and have a beginning menu. I also would like a score feature of some kind.The ultimate best case scenario would be a difficulty scenario 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?
The first thing I will research is how to use rectangle.draw to make more detailed looking figures (or maybe use something else instead). Then I need to figure out how to use collision to erase or "break" a brick. I also need to look into random generation. I feel as there are some elements from pong that can be translated into this project, but i would like to be able for this to flow more smoothley.
